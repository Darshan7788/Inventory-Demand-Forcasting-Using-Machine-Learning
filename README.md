# Inventory Demand Forecasting Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project provides a solution for inventory demand forecasting using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict future inventory requirements based on historical data, enabling businesses to optimize their inventory management processes, reduce costs, and improve efficiency.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** The notebook includes steps to clean and preprocess historical inventory data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creation of new features that might help in better forecasting.
- **Modeling:** Utilizes various machine learning models to forecast inventory demand.
- **Model Evaluation:** Includes evaluation metrics to measure the performance of the models.
- **Visualization:** Provides insights into data and model performance through visualizations.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- XGBoost (or any other library used in the notebook)

You can install the necessary packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Inventory-Demand-Forecasting.git
    cd Inventory-Demand-Forecasting
    ```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

    Open the `Inventory_Demand_Forecasting.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Inventory_Demand_Forecasting.ipynb
    ```

3. **Follow the steps in the notebook:**

    The notebook is organized into sections, guiding you through data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
